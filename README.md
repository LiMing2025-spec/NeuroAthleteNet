# NeuroAthleteNet 🧠🏃‍♂️  
**Neuroimaging-Driven Recommendation Systems for Personalized Sports Training and Injury Prevention**

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and research behind **NeuroAthleteNet**, an advanced neuroimaging-driven recommendation framework designed to enhance **athletic performance** and prevent **sports-related injuries**.

Our system integrates cutting-edge **neuroimaging techniques** with **machine learning** models to personalize training regimens and monitor cognitive-motor functions in real-time.

## 🔬 Abstract
Traditional neuroimaging tools like fMRI, EEG, and DTI have shed light on brain plasticity and motor cognition in athletes. However, their limitations—such as motion sensitivity and poor real-world applicability—have hindered translation into dynamic sports environments.

To address this, we propose:
- **NeuroAthleteNet**: a spatiotemporal neural feature extraction and graph-based analysis framework linking neural patterns to performance.
- **NeuroSportSync**: a multimodal integration pipeline combining neuroimaging, biomechanical, and physiological signals in real-time.

Our approach improves:
- Predictive accuracy in performance assessment
- Interpretability of neural biomarkers
- Applicability in live sports training environments
